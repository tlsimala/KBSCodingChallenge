Hi this is my submission for the Kaleido Coding Challenge! 

My approach was a little more longwinded(I think) than it truly needed to be, but I had a lot of fun thinking this problem through! :D

Instructions:
   To get the code up and running, it is as simple as saving the repository onto your desktop and utilizing your commandline. 
    Of course, depending on where it is saved this step will be different, but just make sure that if you utilize the ls           command you can see the "KaleidoClientCode.java" "Compound.java" "Plate.java" and "Well.java" classes! 
    
    1. Download the repository 
    2. Use the commandline to access it
    3. Type "javac KaliedoClientCode.java Compound.java Plate.java Well.java" or "javac *.java" into the commandline or              terminal 
    4. Type java KaliedoClientCode 
    5. It should be running now and instead of creating a test suite, I wanted you to be able to interact with the program as        if you were a scientist trying to enter information!
    
 I hope that you enjoy my solution! (:
